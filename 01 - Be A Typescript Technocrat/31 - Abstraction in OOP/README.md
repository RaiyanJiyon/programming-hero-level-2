## üî∑ Abstraction in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

### ‚úÖ What is Abstraction?

**Abstraction** is the OOP principle of **hiding complex implementation details** and **showing only essential features** of an object.

> Think of it as **showing *what* an object does**, not *how* it does it.

---

### üîπ Why Use Abstraction?

* Simplifies complex systems
* Focuses on **what matters** to the user
* Encourages **modular**, **clean**, and **maintainable** code
* Helps enforce **contracts** (rules) using abstract classes or interfaces

---

## üî∏ Real-Life Analogy

* When you drive a car, you use the **steering wheel**, **pedals**, and **gear**.
* You don‚Äôt need to understand how the **engine**, **transmission**, or **brakes** work.

> That‚Äôs **abstraction** ‚Äî exposing only **relevant operations** and hiding the **internal complexity**.

## üî∏ How to Implement Abstraction in TypeScript

### ‚úÖ 1. Using `abstract class`

```typescript
abstract class Shape {
  abstract area(): number;  // Abstract method

  describe(): void {
    console.log("This is a shape.");
  }
}

class Circle extends Shape {
  constructor(private radius: number) {
    super();
  }

  area(): number {
    return Math.PI * this.radius * this.radius;
  }
}
```

‚úÖ The `area()` method is **abstract**, so the child class **must implement it**.

---

### üîπ Cannot Instantiate Abstract Classes

```typescript
const s = new Shape(); // ‚ùå Error: Cannot create an instance of an abstract class
```

---

### ‚úÖ 2. Using Interfaces for Abstraction

```typescript
interface Animal {
  makeSound(): void;
}

class Dog implements Animal {
  makeSound(): void {
    console.log("Woof!");
  }
}

class Cat implements Animal {
  makeSound(): void {
    console.log("Meow!");
  }
}
```

‚úÖ The interface `Animal` defines **what** should be done, and each class decides **how**.

## üîπ Abstract vs Interface

| Feature       | `abstract class`           | `interface`                              |
| ------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Inheritance   | Single inheritance only    | Multiple interfaces can be implemented   |
| Constructors  | Can have constructors      | Cannot have constructors                 |
| Method Bodies | Can have method bodies     | Cannot have method bodies (only types)   |
| Use Case      | When you want shared logic | When you only need a contract definition |

## üìå Summary

| Term        | Description                                             |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Abstraction | Hides internal details; exposes only essentials         |
| `abstract`  | Keyword for abstract classes/methods                    |
| Interface   | Blueprint of methods and properties (no implementation) |
| Benefit     | Simplifies code, enforces rules, improves scalability   |

---

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

**Abstraction** is key to managing complexity in software development. It helps you focus on the **interface** rather than the **implementation**, making your programs **simpler to use, easier to extend, and less error-prone**.
