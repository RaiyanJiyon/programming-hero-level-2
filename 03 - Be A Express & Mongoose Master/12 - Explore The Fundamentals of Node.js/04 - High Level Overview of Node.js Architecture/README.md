# 🏗️ Node.js Architecture (High-Level)

At its core, **Node.js** uses an **event-driven, non-blocking, single-threaded architecture**.
Here’s the flow ⬇️

---

## 🔑 Main Components of Node.js Architecture

### 1. **V8 JavaScript Engine (Google)**

* Compiles JavaScript into machine code.
* Makes Node.js **fast**.
* Same engine used in Chrome.

---

### 2. **Single-Threaded Event Loop**

* Node.js runs on **one main thread**.
* Handles **all client requests asynchronously**.
* Uses an **event loop** to manage multiple tasks without blocking.

---

### 3. **Libuv (C/C++ Library)**

* Provides **event loop** and **asynchronous I/O operations**.
* Handles things like:

  * File system tasks
  * Networking
  * DNS lookups
* Uses **thread pool** for heavy operations (not everything is single-threaded).

---

### 4. **Event Queue**

* Stores incoming client requests.
* The **event loop** picks them up one by one.

---

### 5. **Thread Pool (in Libuv)**

* Some tasks (like reading a big file, database queries, crypto) are offloaded to worker threads.
* Once finished, results are sent back to the **event loop**.

---

### 6. **APIs**

* Node.js provides **built-in modules** (e.g., `fs`, `http`, `crypto`) to perform server-side tasks.

---

### 7. **External Resources**

* **Databases** (MongoDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL).
* **External APIs**.

## 🔄 High-Level Flow of a Request

1. **Client Request** → Browser/app sends request (e.g., “Get user profile”).
2. **Event Queue** → Request enters the queue.
3. **Event Loop** → Picks up the request.

   * If it’s a quick task (like returning “Hello World”), process immediately.
   * If it’s heavy (like DB query or file read), send to **Thread Pool**.
4. **Thread Pool (if needed)** → Executes task in the background.
5. **Callback / Promise** → When finished, result goes back to event loop.
6. **Response** → Event loop sends result back to client.

## 🖼️ Simple Diagram (Text Representation)

```
Client Request --> Event Queue --> Event Loop -->  
   |                                      |  
   | (small task) ----------------------> Response  
   |  
   | (heavy task) --> Thread Pool --> Callback --> Event Loop --> Response
```

---

✅ **In short:**

* **Single-threaded event loop** + **non-blocking I/O** = high concurrency.
* **Thread pool** (in Libuv) handles heavy background tasks.
* **V8 engine** makes execution blazing fast.
