# üßµ Node.js as a Single-Threaded Runtime

### ‚úÖ What "Single-Threaded" Means

* Node.js runs your **JavaScript code** on **one main thread**.
* That single thread is responsible for executing your application logic.
* It avoids the overhead of creating new threads for each client request (like PHP, Java, etc.).

üëâ This is why Node.js can handle **thousands of connections** efficiently with less memory.

---

### ‚ö° But Wait ‚Äî Node.js Is *Not Entirely* Single-Threaded

* For **I/O operations** (like file system, networking, database queries), Node.js uses **libuv**.
* **libuv** manages a **thread pool** behind the scenes.
* So while **your JS code runs in one thread**, heavy operations can be offloaded to worker threads.

---

## üîÑ How It Works

1. **Main Thread (Event Loop)**

   * Executes your JS code.
   * Handles events, callbacks, async tasks.

2. **Non-Blocking I/O**

   * Instead of blocking the main thread, I/O requests are delegated to **libuv**.
   * Example: reading a file ‚Üí handed to thread pool.

3. **Thread Pool (Hidden Workers)**

   * Performs heavy work in the background.
   * Sends the result back to the **event loop** when done.

### üìå Example

```js
const fs = require("fs");

console.log("Start");

fs.readFile("bigfile.txt", "utf8", (err, data) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log("File read complete");
});

console.log("End");
```

**Output:**

```
Start
End
File read complete
```

Explanation:

* `fs.readFile` is asynchronous ‚Üí delegated to libuv thread pool.
* Main thread doesn‚Äôt wait ‚Üí keeps running and logs `"End"`.
* When file reading finishes, callback is queued ‚Üí `"File read complete"`.

---

### ‚úÖ Advantages of Single-Threaded Model

* Lightweight, less memory usage.
* Handles **massive concurrent requests** (e.g., chat apps, APIs).
* No context switching between threads.

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

* **CPU-intensive tasks** (image processing, complex loops, ML, crypto) block the main thread ‚Üí everything else pauses.
* That‚Äôs why such work should be offloaded to:

  * **Worker Threads API** in Node.js.
  * Or use **microservices**.

---

‚úÖ **In short:**

* Node.js = single-threaded for **JavaScript execution**.
* Uses **event loop + thread pool** for non-blocking I/O.
* Great for **I/O-heavy** apps, not ideal for **CPU-heavy** apps.
