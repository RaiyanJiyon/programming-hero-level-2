## üåê Introduction to Express.js: Why & How to Get Started

### üß† What Is Express.js?

**Express.js** (or simply *Express*) is a **minimal and flexible web framework** for **Node.js**. It helps developers quickly build **web applications** and **APIs** without having to manage all the low-level details of handling HTTP requests and responses manually.

In other words, Express simplifies the process of:

* Setting up a web server,
* Handling routes (URLs),
* Managing middleware (functions that process requests),
* Sending responses (like HTML, JSON, or files).

### üí° Why Use Express?

Here are some key reasons developers choose Express.js:

#### 1. **Simplicity & Speed**

Node.js on its own can handle HTTP requests, but the syntax is verbose and repetitive. Express abstracts away the boilerplate, so you can create a full web server in just a few lines of code.

#### 2. **Routing**

Express has a built-in router that makes it easy to handle different URLs (routes) and HTTP methods (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`).

#### 3. **Middleware Support**

Middleware functions allow you to add features like:

* Authentication
* Logging
* Body parsing (e.g., reading JSON data from requests)
* Error handling

#### 4. **Huge Ecosystem**

Because Express is one of the most popular Node.js frameworks, there are thousands of compatible packages and tutorials available.

#### 5. **Scalability**

Express is lightweight ‚Äî you can start small (a simple API) and scale up to handle enterprise-level applications.

### ‚öôÔ∏è How to Get Started with Express.js

Let‚Äôs walk through setting it up step-by-step.

#### **1. Prerequisites**

* Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
* Basic understanding of JavaScript
* A code editor (like VS Code)

#### **2. Create a Project Folder**

```bash
mkdir my-express-app
cd my-express-app
```

#### **3. Initialize Node.js**

```bash
npm init -y
```

This creates a `package.json` file.

#### **4. Install Express**

```bash
npm install express
```

#### **5. Create Your First Express Server**

Create a file named `server.js` (or `index.js`) and add:

```js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

// Define a route
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello, Express!');
});

// Start the server
app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server running at http://localhost:${port}`);
});
```

#### **6. Run Your Server**

```bash
node server.js
```

Then open your browser and visit:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

You should see:

> Hello, Express!

### üß© Going Further

Once you‚Äôve got the basics, you can explore:

* **Routing:** organize endpoints with `express.Router()`
* **Middleware:** add functionality like logging and body parsing (`app.use(express.json())`)
* **Templating:** render HTML using EJS, Handlebars, or Pug
* **APIs:** build RESTful APIs for frontend apps or mobile clients
* **Error Handling:** manage 404s and other server errors

### üöÄ Example: Simple REST API

Here‚Äôs a quick example of a basic API:

```js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
app.use(express.json());

let users = [
  { id: 1, name: 'Raiyan' },
  { id: 2, name: 'Aisha' }
];

app.get('/users', (req, res) => res.json(users));
app.post('/users', (req, res) => {
  const newUser = { id: Date.now(), name: req.body.name };
  users.push(newUser);
  res.status(201).json(newUser);
});

app.listen(3000, () => console.log('API running on http://localhost:3000'));
```
